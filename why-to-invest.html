      <h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
      <p><strong>Strategic Positioning of Our Goat & Livestock Enterprise</strong></p>
      <p>
        Our Integrated model is designed not just to manage operational challenges — but to transform them into Structured, invest-able Opportunities.<br>
        Here’s a transparent look at our Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threat mitigation strategies — all Aligned with our Investor-focused growth plan. 
      </p>

      <h3>✅ Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <p><strong>Operational Efficiency | Market Relevance | Environmental Resilience</strong></p>
        <li>Low labor and land requirements due to semi-intensive stall-fed model</li>
        <li>Goats thrive in arid, low-fertility land — enabling productivity where crops fail</li>
        <li>Minimal religious/cultural restrictions on goat meat = strong national demand</li>
        <li>High fertility rate; early maturity and twin births common</li>
        <li>Goat meat is lean, low-fat and medically recommended — expanding health-conscious market</li>
        <li>Animals are disease-resistant and adapt well to harsh conditions</li>
        <li>Small body size = minimal housing and management needs</li>
        <li>Employment generation through rural youth and family labor</li>
        <li>Goats help rejuvenate grazing land and control bush encroachment</li>
        <li>Environmentally sustainable: ideal for circular economy models</li>
        <li>Ongoing partnerships with veterinary colleges and NGOs enhance care quality</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>⚠️ Weaknesses (with Strategic Responses)</h3>
      <p><strong>Addressed Proactively Through Institutional Design</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High Kid Mortality :</strong> Early colostrum feeding, heated pens, vaccination SOP</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Veterinary Support :</strong> Local para-vet training, mobile vet clinics</li>
        <li><strong>Feed Shortages in Drought :</strong> Hydroponic units, silage storage, multi-season fodder planning</li>
        <li><strong>Susceptibility to Disease :</strong> Quarterly deworming, shed disinfection, isolation units</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Record-Keeping :</strong> Digital herd tracking, dedicated farm supervisors</li>
        <li><strong>Unorganized Sales :</strong> Direct agreements, FPO formation</li>
        <li><strong>Financing Barriers :</strong> NABARD/NLM support, formal DPR submitted for bank linkage</li>
        <li><strong>Low Yield Indigenous Breeds :</strong> Crossbreeding, pedigree tracking</li>
        <li><strong>Unorganized Sales :</strong> Direct agreements, FPO formation</li>
        <li><strong>Shed/Land Constraints :</strong> Modular stall-fed sheds, vertical fodder farming</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🚀 Opportunities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rapidly rising demand for Milk and Goat Meat, both Domestically and Globally</li>
        <li>High-margin export potential (A2 Milk, Certified Organic Meat)</li>
        <li>D2C branding in Urban health-focused markets</li>       
        <li>Institutional demand from Pharma, Hotels, Processors</li>
        <li>Access to de-risking schemes (NLM, ESDP)</li>
        <li>D2C branding in Urban health-focused markets</li>
        <li>Expansion via FPO s and franchise-based Rural cluster replication</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🔒 Threats & Mitigation</h3>
      <p><strong>Anticipated Risks | Built-In Defensive Strategies</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Declining grazing land due to
          population & urbanization:</strong> Shift to stall-fed(zero-grazing)model + use of hydroponic fodder and own cultivation</li>
        <li><strong>Price Volatility in meat markets:</strong> Product mix diversification (milk, breeding stock,
          compost), forward contracts with bulk buyers</li>
        <li><strong>Climate Risk affecting feed
          availability:</strong>Drought-resilient fodder systems, silage storage,
          biogas-powered irrigation</li>
        <li><strong>Health & Disease Outbreaks:</strong> Strict biosecurity protocols, emergency Vet plans,
          Isolation sheds</li>
      </ul>
